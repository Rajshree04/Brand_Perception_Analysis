# Brand_Perception_Analysis

## Project Overview
Brand Perception Analysis is a project aimed at understanding public sentiment towards a brand by analyzing comments on its YouTube videos. The primary goal is to extract and classify user sentimentsâ€”positive, negative, or neutral. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, this project provides valuable insights into consumer perceptions, helping brands identify strengths and areas for improvement.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `nltk` for natural language processing tasks
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
  - `vaderSentiment` for sentiment analysis
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
  - Selenium for web scraping YouTube comments
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or Linux

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/brand-perception-analysis.git
    cd brand-perception-analysis
    ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up your environment:**
    - Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed.
    - If scraping new data, ensure Selenium and the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) are installed.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the notebook and execute the cells to perform the analysis.

## Usage Instructions
To use the project:

1. **Data Collection**: If you need to scrape new comments, use the Selenium script provided to collect comments from YouTube.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use the provided notebook to perform sentiment analysis on the comments. The analysis uses VADER for sentiment classification and supports oversampling to balance the dataset.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM) using the provided scripts. Hyperparameter tuning is available via grid search.
5. **Ensemble Model**: Evaluate the ensemble model, which combines predictions from the three classifiers to achieve higher accuracy.
